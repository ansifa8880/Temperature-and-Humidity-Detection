# Temperature-and-Humidity-Detection
An IoT project to monitor temperature and humidity using sensors.
This project demonstrates the use of IoT (Internet of Things) to monitor and track temperature and humidity levels in real-time using sensors and display the data on a web interface. The data is collected from a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor, processed by a microcontroller (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi), and sent to a cloud platform for visualization and analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors temperature and humidity levels.
- **Data Logging**: Logs temperature and humidity data over time for analysis.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays real-time temperature and humidity readings on a web page.
- **Alerts**: Sends alerts when temperature or humidity goes beyond predefined thresholds.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any other compatible IoT device.
- **Sensor**: DHT11 or DHT22 (for temperature and humidity sensing).
- **Wi-Fi Module**: ESP8266 or any other module to connect the device to the internet.
- **Other**: Jumper wires, breadboard, and power supply.

## Software Requirements

- **Programming Language**: C/C++ (for Arduino), Python (for Raspberry Pi).
- **Libraries**: `DHT`, `ESP8266WiFi`, `Adafruit_Sensor` (for Arduino); `Adafruit_DHT`, `Flask` (for Raspberry Pi).
- **Cloud Platform**: [Insert Cloud Service name] or [Local server setup] (e.g., ThingSpeak, AWS IoT, etc.).
- **Web Dashboard**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for front-end visualization).
